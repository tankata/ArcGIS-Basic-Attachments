# ArcGIS Basic Attachments
ArcObjects C#.NET Tool to create an attachment table for those with a Basic license level

The ability to attach files and documents to features in ArcGIS is available to those with Standard and Advanced license levels. This tool aims to provide some that same ability at the Basic level.

This was originally built for attaching plans and permits to a parcel layer, so those naming conventions still exist. It was also compilied for ArcGIS 10.1. In addition to generalizing the field and table names, I plan to recompile for 10.4 or 10.5.

Another goal is to replace some of the hardcoded values with softcoded ones instead.
